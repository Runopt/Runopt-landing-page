            <p className="policy-text">
            The Department of Energy (DOE) and the federal government are driving new initiatives to streamline data center infrastructure, especially those powering artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p className="policy-text">
            As many of us already know, on July 23, 2025, a recent Executive Order directs expedited federal permitting, prioritizes siting on federal land, and targets projects over 100MW, notably fast-tracking AI-related builds.

            </p>
            <p className="policy-text">
            The DOE is also investing in grid reliability, flexible load management, and encouraging innovative power solutions through loan guarantees and tax incentives. These initiatives can significantly cut permitting timelines for projects qualifying under federal guidelines.

            California's new legislative package introduces strict measures on data centers for energy efficiency, carbon sourcing, and transparency through bills like AB 222 and AB 93.

            California's new water disclosure bill (AB 93), combined with local mandates (like Santa Clara's required use of recycled water, and Contra Costa County strongly encouraging the use of industrial recycled water for cooling), reinforces the growing regulatory focus on water accountability and sustainability for data centers.
